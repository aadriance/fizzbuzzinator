You see Ferris the Rustacean, when I was but a freshman at Drusselstein Tech I was asked to solve “FizzBuzz”. However, I was so nervous I forgot that the modulo operator existed and invented one from scratch. I was ridiculed for not using it, and “over complicating my solution”. Now I’ll make them see, they’ll all see! Behold my FizzBuzzinator!
