Fizzbuzzinator!

What is a crustacean doing in my lab? I haven’t been able to afford sea food in years…

⚙️🦀⚙️

Ferris the Rustacean! How unprecedented, and by unprecedented, I mean completely precedented!

🛢⚙️🦀⚙️🛢

Take that Ferris the Rustacean! Now you’re caught between a barrel and… well another barrel.

🛢⚙️🦀💦⚙️🛢

You see Ferris the Rustacean, when I was but a freshman at Drusselstein Tech I was asked to solve “FizzBuzz”. However, I was so nervous I forgot that the modulo operator existed and invented one from scratch. I was ridiculed for not using it, and “over complicating my solution”. Now I’ll make them see, they’ll all see! Behold my FizzBuzzinator!

We’ll see who has over complicated their solution now! Hahahahah!!!

Ferris the Rustacean where did you go?

💥👊💥

Ouch! You clobbered my nose with your claw. That’s just ru-wait what are you doing Ferris the Rustacean?

🎚⚙️🦀⚙️

Wait don’t pull that lever!

💥💥💥💥💥

Curse you Ferris the Rustacean!

# Introduction

As we have all come to accept that the oxidization deah of legacy software is 
inevitable (/jk). The advances of Rust are often focused on complex and
important work. In order to contribute to a more diverse equity of software
written in Rust I have created this completely useless program full of FizzBuzz
implementations.

# But Why?

What? You didn't get any of my EVIL monolouge? Okay so when I was a freshman at
Drusselstein Tech, you following?

For real, I ran accross ["FizzBuzz in Haskell by Embedding a Domain-Specific Language"](https://themonadreader.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/fizzbuzz.pdf).
It was all over from there. I couldn't get FizzBuzz out of my head and thinking
of different way to solve it. The natrual conclusion was needing to race all
those solutions.
